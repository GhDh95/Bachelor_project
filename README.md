# Bachelor_project

An e-commerce website built in PHP, SQL, AlpineJs, TailwindCSS.

This was done in a group of 3. 

I did not code :

*The PHPMailer functions

*The order/rate pages and their functions

*The profile page functions like Newsletter

*Some related functions in the Models


This is my first project.

I have been able to learn so much about CRUD, responsive web design,
Ajax requests, Git and Github, code structure and coding in a team.
